# Elastic Cloud Compute - EC2

- Web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

- i.e. Virtual Machines in the cloud.

- Pay only for capacity that you use.

- Types:

  - __On demand__: pay by the minute/second no commitement
    - Low cost
    - Flexible
    - Uninterupable
    - Prototyping
    - Most popular
  - __Reserved__: Capacity reservation. Cheaper than above. 1 - 3 year terms.
    - Steady state
    - Predicable usage
    - Reserved capacity
    - Upfront payments reduce cost
    - Types:
      - Standard RI (75% off on demand)
      - Convertible RI (54% off on demand)
      - Scheduled RIs - allows you to launch for specific time windows for peak demand.
  - __Spot__: bid price based on supply/demand. Useful if App has flexible start/end times.
    - Flexible start and end times
    - Apps that are only feasible at low compute prices
  - __Dedicated Host__: Physical EC2 dedicated.
    - Regulatory requirement
    - Where multi tennant isn't wanted.

  ## EC2 Instance types

  ![Instance Types](img/instance types.png)

- Dr Mc Gift PX

  D - Density

  R - RAM

  M - General Purpose

  G - Graphics

  I - Iops

  F - FPGA

  T - general purpose (cheap)

  P - General purpose graphics

  X - Exreme Memory

# EBS - Elastic Block Storage

- Discs that can be attached to EC2 VMs.

- Suitable for filesystems/dbs etc.

- Automatically replicated to same availability zone.

- Types:

  - General Purpose SSD (SP2)
    - Balance between performance and price.
    - Configurable IOPS
  - Provisioned IOPS SSD (I01)
    - Designed for IOPS intensive operations i.e. dbs. 
    - 10000+ IOPS
  - Throughput Optimised HDD (ST1)
    - Big data
    - Data warehouse
    - Log processing
    - Sequential data
    - Cannot be a boot volume
  - Cold HDD (SC1)
    - Fileservers
    - Low cost storage for infrequently used data.
    - Cannot be boot volume.
  - Magnetic Standard
    - Can be a boot volume
    - Data is accessed infrequently.
    - Low cost important.

  ## Exam Tips

  - Know the differences between pricing models for EC2 servers
    - On demand
    - Spot (self terminated - pay by the hour; AWS terminated they pay the hour)
    - Reserved
    - Dedicated
  - EBS consists of:
    - SSD General Purpose - GP2 - Up to 10000 IOPS
    - SSD Provisioned IOPS - I01 - 10000+ IOPS 
    - HDD Throughput Optimized (ST1)
    - Cold HDD (SC1)
    - Magnetic Standard
  - EBS volumes can be attached to only one EC2 instance.
  - Use cases for EC2 instance types (above)
